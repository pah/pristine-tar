Run ./Makefile.PL to generate a Makefile, then run `make` and `make install`.

You may specify the following parameters upon the invocation of ./Makefile.PL to adapt pristine-tar to your environment:

PERL_SHEBANG=<shell-shebang-to-launch-perl-script>
TAR_PROGRAM=<name-or-path-to-gnu-tar>
XDELTA_PROGRAM=<name-or-path-to-xdelta1>

The PERL_SHEBANG needs only to be adapted in rare cases, as it is usually correctly set by MakeMaker. However, the TAR_PROGRAM should refer to the GNU version of Tar, which may be called, e.g., "tar" (default), "gtar", or "gnutar" depending on the system. The XDELTA_PROGRAM needs to refer to the Xdelta program in version 1.x (http://xdelta.org), which may be called, e.g., "xdelta" (default) or "xdelta1". Xdelta3 won't work, as it has a different command line syntax.

The installation destination (default: /usr/local) can be specified either via the ./Makefile.PL parameter:

PREFIX=<installation-prefix>

or

INSTALL_BASE=<installation-prefix>

Please, see the manpage of ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more details.


EXAMPLE:

$ ./Makefile.PL TAR_PROGRAM=gnutar XDELTA_PROGRAM=xdelta PREFIX=/usr/local
$ make
$ make install
