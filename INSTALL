Run `perl Makefile.PL` to generate a Makefile, then run `make` and
`make install`.

To configure pristine-tar for your local environment, you may specify
the following additional parameters to Makefile.PL for the creation
of the Makefile

PERL_SHEBANG=<shell-shebang-to-launch-perl-script>
TAR_PROGRAM=<name-or-path-to-gnu-tar>
XDELTA_PROGRAM=<name-or-path-to-xdelta1>

The PERL_SHEBANG needs only to be adapted in rare cases, as it is usually
correctly set by MakeMaker. However, the TAR_PROGRAM should refer to the GNU
version of Tar, which may be called, e.g., "tar" (default), "gtar", or
"gnutar" depending on the system. The XDELTA_PROGRAM needs to refer to the
Xdelta program in version 1.x (http://xdelta.org), which may be called, e.g.,
"xdelta" (default) or "xdelta1". Xdelta3 won't work, as it has a different
command line syntax.

The installation destination (default: /usr/local) can be specified either
via the ./Makefile.PL parameter:

PREFIX=<installation-prefix>

or

INSTALL_BASE=<installation-prefix>

See the manpage (or perldoc) of ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more details.


EXAMPLE:

$ perl Makefile.PL \
    TAR_PROGRAM=gnutar \
    XDELTA_PROGRAM=xdelta \
    PREFIX=/usr/local
$ make
$ make install
