pristine-tar (1.26.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * First version of pristine-tar to compile and work on Mac OS X.
  * Makefile.PL: Fix to always take into account $(PREFIX) when
    installing files (i.e., pristine-tar, pristine-gz, pristine-bz2,
    pristine-xz, zgz, and its man pages). Configure shebang line and
    names of tar as well as xdelta in the Perl scripts generated from
    pristine-tar.in, pristine-gz.in, pristine-bz2.in, pristine-xz.in.
    The in-place editing option '-i' of sed is not anymore used to
    update pristine-tar.spec. The option is not supported by sed on
    all Unix platforms.
  * pristine-tar, pristine-gz, pristine-bz2, pristine-xz: Renamed to
    pristine-tar.in, pristine-gz.in, pristine-bz2.in, pristine-xz.in,
    respectively. Shebang to call Perl is now configured from within
    Makefile.PL as well is the actual name of tar and xdelta. Thus,
    porting of pristine-tar to other Unix-like platforms is
    facilitated, where these programs these programs may have a
    different name (e.g., gnutar, gtar, xdelta1) or are installed in
    places outside the user's PATH.
  * zgz/zgz.c: Use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH to swap
    in dynamic library on Mac OS X.
  * pit/suse-bzip2/Makefile: Fix to compile libbz2 as dynamic library
    on Mac OS X.

pristine-tar (1.26) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * pristine-xz: Use xz --robot to extract information from xz files,
    avoiding the need to do more expensive guessing. Support --block-list
    when available to reproduce multi block files.

pristine-tar (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Store the sha1 of the tree that is being committed, rather than
    a sha1 of a commit or other object that points to the tree.
    This makes committed tarballs more resilient against git filter-branch
    when it's only used to change commit metadata. Closes: #467288

pristine-tar (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * pristine-tar: Fail when the delta is excessively large, probably
    due to the tarball being compressed with something that tar x can 
    auto-extract, but that pristine-tar does not support.

pristine-tar (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for gzip --rsyncable output produced by gzip 1.4.
    This differs from prior --rsyncable output, which was made by a Debian
    specific patch and used a different rsync window size, and reset
    huffman encodings less often.
  * Clarify man page.

pristine-tar (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add workaround for Debian's tar changing its output for tarballs
    containing filenames exactly 100 bytes long. Closes: #602907
    (Needs tar 1.25-2 with #603231 fixed in order for that to work.)

pristine-tar (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * pristine-gz gengz: Bugfix: Always remove uncompressed input file.
  * Large refactoring and modularization. (Thanks Gabriel de Perthuis
    for inspiration for this.))
  * Remove environment variables used by tar, gz, and bzip2, to avoid
    local environment settings possibly breaking things.
    Closes: #498760 (probably; thanks Ralph Lange for analysis)
  * Lintian fixes.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Aug 2010 16:36:25 -0400

pristine-tar (1.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * zgz now includes a trimmed down copy of the compressor from bzip2 0.9.5d.
    That old version of bzip2 generated different compression results,
    and is the overwhelming reason for failures to reproduce bz2 files
    in the Debian archive. Closes: #560170, #579657, #525128, #576119
    (Special thanks to Laszlo Ersek for tracking this down.)
  * Awesome new zgz man page!
  * Faster generation of bzip2 deltas: Do not repeatedly decompress
    input file.
  * pristine-bz2 -t can be used to make it try harder to generate
    a delta. Currently, this tries pbzip2 -b with various numbers.
    Not the default because it's slow and I don't have any bzip2 files
    from the wild that were built that way.

pristine-tar (1.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * pristine-gz: Fall back to storing a binary delta, in the rare
    cases where the file cannot be 100% reproduced. A warning message
    is printed if the binary delta is not relatively small.
  * Allows generating quite small deltas for php-geoip,
    xsupplicant, libgraphics-colornames-perl,
    Ricoh-Aficio_2020D-Postscript.ppd.gz, and dozens on others
    that zgz can closely replicate. Closes: #518972, #506874
  * For other things the deltas are not as small.
    This seems an accepable tradeoff to be able to reliably use it on
    anything. Closes: #475778, #509703, #509707, #515256, #515331
  * Increase gz delta version number to 3.0 if a binary delta file
    is included.
  * pristine-tar: Avoid dying in corner case involving tar's filename
    encoding. Fixes several failures.
  * pristine-tar: Avoid dying if tar tv exits nonzero. This makes
    reproducing star's tarball work, even though tar gets upset
    while listing it and decides to die at the end.
  * pristine-gz: Avoid passing -F to zgz if --original-name
    is passed. This bug prevented pristine-gz gengz from
    recreating the gz in some cases. 
  * Add aliases ci and co for commit and checkout. Closes: #500388
  * pristine-gz: Fix generation of gz files that have a null filename field.
  * pristine-tar: Fix behavior in the corner case where the tarball
    puts all files in a subdir, but does not contain the subdir's directory
    entry.

  [ Josh Triplett ]
  * Add a .gitignore file
  * Various cleanups to zgz.
  * Remove the unnecessary -l, -S, -t, and -v flags from zgz.
  * Allow the empty string as an original filename in zgz, rather than
    treating the empty string as a flag to not store an original filename.
  * Fix zgz's usage message to stop identifying the program as gzip.
  * Add a new -T,--timestamp flag to zgz, to explicitly set the timestamp
    stored in the gzip file, rather than taking the timestamp of the input
    file. Closes: #507110

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * zgz: Avoid using uninitialized data as timestamp in -c mode.
    Closes: #507095
  * Document existing long options. Closes: #499488
  * Avoid exposing tar file names to the shell. Closes: #500499
  * Clarify bit in man page about what file formats are supported.
    Closes: #507322

  [ Josh Triplett ]
  * zgz: Incorporate a cut-down version of GNU gzip to support the --gnu
    option.  The cut-down gzip includes support for explicitly setting the
    timestamp and original filename. Closes: #506627
  * pristine-gz: Now that zgz supports explicitly setting the timestamp and
    original filename with both --zlib and --gnu, use that support to do all
    compression using -c with standard input and standard output.  This
    removes the need to create a temporary file with the original filename and
    set its timestamp, as well as the need to continuously recreate the file
    when compressed and removed. Closes: #506627
  * zgz: Remove support for files, making -c the default.  This removes a lot
    of complexity and code duplication.

pristine-tar (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * pristine-gz: Always pass -f to zgz, to support cases where
    the gzip header claims that the original input file had an extension
    that suggests it was itself already compressed. (Although it can't really
    be.) Not doing the same for gzip because -f doesn't cause it to ignore
    extensions. See #475778

  * Prefer to commit to the ref that exactly matches what is specified at the
    command line.
  * Send all debug and verbose prints to stderr, reserving stdout for
    outputting deltas etc.
  * pristine-tar commit was not generating deltas against the specified
    upstream branch, but against the unpacked contents of the source tarball.
    Fix it to use the upstream branch, ensuring that no matter what branch is
    given, the delta that is created can always recreate the source tarball.

  * If a tarball contains files all in one subdirectory, and the source
    tree it's being generated from already has that subdirectory, don't
    try to create the subdir, which would fail. OTOH, if the subdirectory
    isn't there, proceed with creating it as before.
  * Add support for bz2 files (Cyril Brulebois)
  * Recommends bzip2 and pbzip2, which both might be needed when dealing
    with bz2 files due to differences in their output.

pristine-tar (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve search for upstream branch. Default to looking for first
    refs/heads/upstream, and failing that, anything with "upstream" in its
    name. This way if there is a local upstream branch and a remote one, it
    will use the local one. If there's only a remote one, it'll use that.
    Closes: #463566

pristine-tar (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved to git, and added a Vcs-Browser field.
  * pristine-tar can now "commit" deltas for a tarball directly to a git
    branch, and then "checkout" the original tarball again. Git users
    are recommended to use these new subcommands because they're easier,
    store the deltas in a consistent location, and avoid problems with
    recreating things like empty directories that git doesn't track.
    Closes: #463352
  * Thanks to madcoder for help with manipulating git branches without
    touching the working copy.
  * Fix paranoia check in pristine-gz to correctly handle parameters

  * pristine-tar sometimes got confused about tarballs that did not unpack

  * tar was confused by files starting with ./ or / in the manifest, so
    strip it out. Fixes erlang-doc-html and 19 others, including doc-fdc,
    which is the only package to have files in / in its tarball.
  * Some tarballs put files in a subdir, but don't show a "/" after the subdir
    name in a manifest. Stop relying on that. (example: streamtuner)

  * Renamed the subcommands extract => gentar , stash => gendelta
  * Quite a lot of testing (ie, on the entire Debian archive) and bugfixes.
  * Put files in the generated tarball mode 0644 pre-delta, this is a much
    more likely file mode than the previous 0000 and thus makes the delta
    smaller.
  * File format version is up to 2.0 due to misc incompatible changes.
  * Fix a bug related to tar's handling of unicode filenames.
  * Work around a strange tar behavior: When run with --mode 644, tar
    preserves the sgid bit on subdirectories.

  Current stats: Out of the whole debian archive, pristine-gz fails
  on 131 files, and pristine-tar fails on 45. Success with 98.63% of
